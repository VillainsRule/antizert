# BYPASS ALL ZERTALIOUS ADS!!

Installed ANY of these scripts?
- Krunker.IO Aimbot & ESP
- 1v1.LOL Aimbot, ESP & Wireframe View
- Shellshock.IO Aimbot & ESP
- Ev.IO Aimbot & ESP
- Voxiom.IO Aimbot, ESP & X-Ray

Is the author named Zertalious?

Does it redirect you to zertalious.xyz?

Are you tired of scrolling through 4 pages of ads?

## INSTALL THIS!

Once you install "antizert", this script will quietly run in the background, and you will likely forget this exists.

You'll never see an ad again from any scripts. That's how easy it is!

Note: for some scripts like Krunker, it will briefly show zertalious.xyz in the search bar. This should instantly disappear.

## READ THIS FOR SHELL SHOCKERS

There is a **MUCH BETTER** client with NO ads that has features like ANTIBLOOM, PREDICTION, and UNBANNING!

You should UNINSTALL "Shellshock.IO Aimbot & ESP" and install "StateFarm Client" today!

## Couldn't detect a URL?

1. Visit the game you're trying to play again (i.e. retype krunker.io or 1v1.lol into the search bar)
2. If the issue persists, go to https://greasyfork.org/scripts/524543/feedback and show logs from the browser console!
